# Toxicity Detection in Large Language Models
## Course Project - CS772 - Deep Learning for NLP

This is our attempt at the course project of the course CS772.  

First create a python virtual environment and then install all dependencies using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The learned weights of the vectorizer can be found in `vectorizer.pkl`

The model weights can be found in `model.pth`

To boot up the User Interface for model inference    

```bash
python3 ui.py
```
