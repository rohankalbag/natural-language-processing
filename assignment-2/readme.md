# Natively Implemented Recurrent Perceptron for Parts-Of-Speech Tagging

## Assignment 2 - CS772 - Deep Learning for NLP

This is our attempt at the second assignment of the course CS772.  

First create a python virtual environment and then install all dependencies using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The learned weights of the final model are loaded in the form of a pickled in the UI for inference. They can be found in `model_3000_10.pkl`

To boot up the User Interface for model inference    

```bash
python3 ui.py
```

PDF of slides has been added in the folder as `cs772-2024-assignment2.pdf`.

Dataloader_example.ipynb contains code to load data, train model and test it, including 5 fold cross validation.

utils.py contains the code for the recuurent perceptron along with forward pass, back propagation with time implementation and the training loop.

`ui.py` contains the code for the UI.

`pos_tag.ipynb` contains the code to use the NLTK toolkit to generate POS tags for a sentence input to the UI.

`Analysis.ipynb` contains the printed error cases and their analysis (conclusions in PPT).

Final trained model weights with best accuracy are in `model_3000_10.pkl` .
