# Natively Implemented Fully Connected Neural Network for Palindrome Detection in Binary Strings

## Assignment 1 - CS772 - Deep Learning for NLP

This is our attempt at the first assignment of the course CS772.  

First create a python virtual environment and then install all dependencies using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The learned weights of the final model are loaded in the form of a pickled list (49 weights) in the UI. They can be found in `model_wts.pkl`

To boot up the User Interface for model inference    

```bash
python3 ui.py
```

The training loop of the main model can be found in `Palindrome.ipynb`, and the 4-fold cross validation and analysis is present in `Palindrome_Analysis.ipynb`. Note that the final model used for the interface is different from the one reported in 4-fold cross validation. This is because of the stochastic nature of weight initialization. The results are, however,  nearly same, since the hyperparameters and training methods used are identical.
